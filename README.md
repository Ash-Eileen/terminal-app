## **Software Development Plan**

### **Statement of Purpose and Scope**

Hangman is designed for entertainment purposes. If you're bored and need something to do you can turn to this hangman app. It can provide a fun distraction when you need a break using single-player mode or you can play with friends using multi-player mode.

#### **What Hangman will do**

There will be three executable files - one to launch single-player mode, one to launch multi-player mode and one with both options included. In single-player mode the app will advise the player that a random word has been generated for them to guess. The user will be able to input single letter guesses and full words. This will continue until the full hangman picture has generated or the word has been guessed. Multi-player mode will work in the same way, however, firstly it will ask Player 1 to enter a word to be guessed. On game over whether won or lost there will be ASCII art generated of a cat. Which art is generated will depend on the outcome. There will then be the option to play again or exit. Any input by the user will be checked to ensure it doesn't include any special characters or numbers, this will include both the word to be guessed and any guesses entered. A message will be displayed if the input does not match these requirements and the user will be asked to re-enter the input correctly.

#### **Target Audience**

This app is targeted towards gamers, lovers of words and anyone needing a distraction from whatever is troubling them. The user will need access to the command line so this would be more suitable to a Mac or Linux user or a developer.

#### **How The Audience will use Hangman**

Hangman will be launched from the command line using any of the executable files listed in the [installation section](https://github.com/Ash-Eileen/terminal-app#installation-instructions) of this README.md document. The game will have single-player mode where a random word will be generated by a gem for the user to guess or can be multi-player mode where one person will enter a word for the others to guess. There is no limit on the number of players in multi-player mode, however, only one user will be able to type the guesses at a time due to the limited functionality of the command line interface.

### **Features**

#### **Single-player Mode Generates a Random Word**

Hangman provides the option for a single player mode with a randomly generated word. This utilises a gem to generate a random word. The gem being used is random-word-generator. The word length is checked and then a string is be displayed with underscores replacing each letter to represent the word. The random word is a dictionary word and not a random string of characters to ensure this game mode is actually playable for the user. When this game mode is either selected in the full game file from the menu or when running the single-player only mode a message is generated advising the user that a random word has been generated for them to guess.

#### **Multi-player Mode In Which One Player Can Enter a Word for Others to Guess**

The game also include a multi-player mode. This game mode is for 2+ players. There is no limit on the number of users for this mode. In this mode an instruction screen is displayed advising that one person will enter a word for the others to guess and the other users are prompted to look away from the screen so the first player can enter a word. This input is then checked using error handling to ensure that it is a string with no special characters or numbers. If the word meets these requirements it is then be stored and a string is displayed with underscores replacing each letter to represent the word. The other players will then be able to guess letters and the word.

#### **User Interface and User Experience**

To try and make the terminal app more visually pleasing I have used a few different methods. For transition screens such as the welcome screen and also for the screen displaying instructions or message, I have utilised a method to mimic the appearance of typing across the screen. I am also using colorize to break up the screen with coloured ASCII art and to display my customised hangman title. The ASCII art I've chosen to go with is cats because I'm a big cat lover. I think this makes the game a bit more fun for users to see the theme of cats throughout the game.

### **User Interaction and Experience**

The game starts with the menu screen being displayed.

![Welcome Screen](https://github.com/Ash-Eileen/terminal-app/blob/master/docs/welcome_screen.png)

If the file launched includes both single-player and multi-player the menu will then be displayed.

![Menu Screen](https://github.com/Ash-Eileen/terminal-app/blob/master/docs/menu.png)

If the user selects single-player mode or has launched the single player only mode then a screen will be displayed stating that a random word has been generated.

![Single-Player Screen](https://github.com/Ash-Eileen/terminal-app/blob/master/docs/single_player.png)

If the user selects multi-player mode or has launched the multi-player only mode then a screen will be displayed stating that one player will need to enter a word and will prompt the guessers to look away.

![Multi-Player Screen 1](https://github.com/Ash-Eileen/terminal-app/blob/master/docs/multi_1.png)

A player will then be prompted to enter a word to be guessed. This entry will be checked to ensure that it does not contain any special characters or numbers. If the entry does contain any characters that are not allowed the user will be prompted to re-enter the word until it meets the requirements.

![Multi-Player Screen 2](https://github.com/Ash-Eileen/terminal-app/blob/master/docs/multi_2.png)

From here the guesses can enter words or letters to guess. The guessers input will be checked to ensure it has not been guessed previously and that it doesn't contain any special characters or numbers. This entry will be checked to ensure that it does not contain any special characters or numbers. If the entry does contain any characters that are not allowed the user will be prompted to re-enter their guess until it meets the requirements. Any invalid entries will not count towards the guesses.

If the user guesses right they will see the winning screen.

If the user runs out of guesses they will see the loss screen.

![Loss Screen](https://github.com/Ash-Eileen/terminal-app/blob/master/docs/loss.png)

At this point the user will have the opportunity to exit or play again. If they choose to play again they will either be taken the menu screen if they launched the file launched including both single-player and multi-player the menu will then be displayed or they will be taken the respective multi-player or single-player screen as described above.

This will continue until the user elects to exit the game.

## **Implementation Plan**

On day one I came to my educators with four ideas. I was leaning towards Hangman and after discussing with Nandini and Lin decided that was my best option. I had a very clear picture in my mind of how the game would work and the confidence that I could code it in the week provided. The planning for my hangman app became pretty straightforward from there. It primarily done using the above flowchart in addition to my Trello Board. I used labelling to show what was grading criteria, what was critical to the success of the app and what would be an optional feature. I then moved items between checklists as needed.
