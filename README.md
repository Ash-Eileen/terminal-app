## **Software Development Plan**

### **Statement of Purpose and Scope**

Hangman is designed for entertainment purposes. If you're bored and need something to do you can turn to this hangman app. It can provide a fun distraction when you need a break using single-player mode or you can play with friends using multi-player mode.

#### **What Hangman will do**

There will be three executable files - one to launch single-player mode, one to launch multi-player mode and one with both options included. In single-player mode the app will advise the player that a random word has been generated for them to guess. The user will be able to input single letter guesses and full words. This will continue until the full hangman picture has generated or the word has been guessed. Multi-player mode will work in the same way, however, firstly it will ask Player 1 to enter a word to be guessed. On game over whether won or lost there will be ASCII art generated of a cat. Which art is generated will depend on the outcome. There will then be the option to play again or exit. Any input by the user will be checked to ensure it doesn't include any special characters or numbers, this will include both the word to be guessed and any guesses entered. A message will be displayed if the input does not match these requirements and the user will be asked to re-enter the input correctly.

#### **Target Audience**

This app is targeted towards gamers, lovers of words and anyone needing a distraction from whatever is troubling them. The user will need access to the command line so this would be more suitable to a Mac or Linux user or a developer.

#### **How The Audience will use Hangman**

Hangman will be launched from the command line using any of the executable files listed in the [installation section](https://github.com/Ash-Eileen/terminal-app#installation-instructions) of this README.md document. The game will have single-player mode where a random word will be generated by a gem for the user to guess or can be multi-player mode where one person will enter a word for the others to guess. There is no limit on the number of players in multi-player mode, however, only one user will be able to type the guesses at a time due to the limited functionality of the command line interface.

------

### **Features**

#### **Single-player Mode Generates a Random Word**

Hangman provides the option for a single player mode with a randomly generated word. This utilises a gem to generate a random word. The gem being used is random-word-generator. The word length is checked and then a string is be displayed with underscores replacing each letter to represent the word. The random word is a dictionary word and not a random string of characters to ensure this game mode is actually playable for the user. When this game mode is either selected in the full game file from the menu or when running the single-player only mode a message is generated advising the user that a random word has been generated for them to guess.

#### **Multi-player Mode In Which One Player Can Enter a Word for Others to Guess**

The game also include a multi-player mode. This game mode is for 2+ players. There is no limit on the number of users for this mode. In this mode an instruction screen is displayed advising that one person will enter a word for the others to guess and the other users are prompted to look away from the screen so the first player can enter a word. This input is then checked using error handling to ensure that it is a string with no special characters or numbers. If the word meets these requirements it is then be stored and a string is displayed with underscores replacing each letter to represent the word. The other players will then be able to guess letters and the word.

#### **User Interface and User Experience**

To try and make the terminal app more visually pleasing I have used a few different methods. For transition screens such as the welcome screen and also for the screen displaying instructions or message, I have utilised a method to mimic the appearance of typing across the screen. I am also using colorize to break up the screen with coloured ASCII art and to display my customised hangman title. The ASCII art I've chosen to go with is cats because I'm a big cat lover. I think this makes the game a bit more fun for users to see the theme of cats throughout the game.

### **User Interaction and Experience**

The game starts with the menu screen being displayed.

![Welcome Screen](https://github.com/Ash-Eileen/terminal-app/blob/master/docs/welcome_screen.png)

If the file launched includes both single-player and multi-player the menu will then be displayed.

![Menu Screen](https://github.com/Ash-Eileen/terminal-app/blob/master/docs/menu.png)

If the user selects single-player mode or has launched the single player only mode then a screen will be displayed stating that a random word has been generated.

![Single-Player Screen](https://github.com/Ash-Eileen/terminal-app/blob/master/docs/single_player.png)

If the user selects multi-player mode or has launched the multi-player only mode then a screen will be displayed stating that one player will need to enter a word and will prompt the guessers to look away.

![Multi-Player Screen 1](https://github.com/Ash-Eileen/terminal-app/blob/master/docs/multi_1.png)

A player will then be prompted to enter a word to be guessed. This entry will be checked to ensure that it does not contain any special characters or numbers. If the entry does contain any characters that are not allowed the user will be prompted to re-enter the word until it meets the requirements.

![Multi-Player Screen 2](https://github.com/Ash-Eileen/terminal-app/blob/master/docs/multi_2.png)

From here the guesses can enter words or letters to guess. The guessers input will be checked to ensure it has not been guessed previously and that it doesn't contain any special characters or numbers. This entry will be checked to ensure that it does not contain any special characters or numbers. If the entry does contain any characters that are not allowed the user will be prompted to re-enter their guess until it meets the requirements. Any invalid entries will not count towards the guesses.

If the user guesses right they will see the winning screen.

![Winning Screen](https://github.com/Ash-Eileen/terminal-app/blob/master/docs/win.png)

If the user runs out of guesses they will see the loss screen.

![Loss Screen](https://github.com/Ash-Eileen/terminal-app/blob/master/docs/loss.png)

At this point the user will have the opportunity to exit or play again. If they choose to play again they will either be taken the menu screen if they launched the file launched including both single-player and multi-player the menu will then be displayed or they will be taken the respective multi-player or single-player screen as described above.

This will continue until the user elects to exit the game.

## **Implementation Plan**

On day one I came to my educators with four ideas. I was leaning towards Hangman and after discussing with Nandini and Lin decided that was my best option. I had a very clear picture in my mind of how the game would work and the confidence that I could code it in the week provided. The planning for my hangman app became pretty straightforward from there. It primarily done using the above flowchart in addition to my Trello Board. I used labelling to show what was grading criteria, what was critical to the success of the app and what would be an optional feature. I then moved items between checklists as needed.

## **Testing**

For the creation of this application I used a mix of manual testing and tests that were designed using [test-unit](https://github.com/test-unit/test-unit). The tests that I designed are included in the [test.rb](https://github.com/Ash-Eileen/terminal-app/blob/master/src/classes/tests.rb) file with comments advising of their purpose. These tests were focussed primarily around ensuring that the word generation and guessing worked correctly. Test were carried out by myself, my partner and family. Fellow classmates also tried the executable files to ensure these worked correctly and ran tests from the below table. The below table provides an outline of the manual tests done.

| Feature                                                      | Expected Outcome                                             | Actual Outcome                                               | Any remaining issues?                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Single-Player Mode Generates a Random Word**               | A random word is generated using the random-word-generator gem | As expected                                                  | Nil                                                          |
| **Multi-Player Mode Requests a Word**                        | User is prompted to enter a word. If the word contains special characters or numbers then the a message is displayed advising the user to retry their entry. This continues until entry is valid. | As expected                                                  | Nil                                                          |
| **Hidden Word is Generated with Underscores in Place of Letters** | Word length matches the word to be guessed. All characters are replaced with underscores and spaces between letters are easily identified | As expected                                                  | Nil                                                          |
| **Guesses Update the Attempts and Hidden Word**              | When a letter is guessed correctly the letter is added to the hidden word and replaces the underscore. Incorrect guesses are added to the attempts array. | As expected                                                  | Nil                                                          |
| **Guesses Cannot be Repeated or Special Characters, Numbers** | When a guess is repeated or does not fulfil the requirements of being a letter or word a message is displayed advising the entry is invalid and the user is prompted to retry. No guesses are used for this. | As expected                                                  | Nil                                                          |
| **If Word is Guessed Correctly then Player Wins**            | If user enters full word correctly or the letters are populated correctly individually then the player wins the game. | As expected                                                  | Nil                                                          |
| **If the Player Runs Out of Guesses the Player Loses**       | When guesses run out a message is displayed showing the word that they were guessing and then the player loses the game. | As expected                                                  | Nil                                                          |
| **Welcome Screen Displays Correctly**                        | Text outside of hangman title has scrolling appearance. Welcome screen is displayed briefly before displaying next screen. | User can type during this process and it displays to screen, otherwise as expected | This is slightly frustrating but doesn't impact function. Utilising tty-cursor to hide cursor so user is less tempted to type. |
| **Menu Screen Displays Correctly and Takes User Input Correctly** | The menu displays properly with title and cat. The tty-prompt gem functions correctly and user input results in the correct option being selected. | Arrows don't display on Ubuntu, otherwise functions as expected | This is slightly frustrating but doesn't impact function of menu so no plans to change. |
| **Instructions are Displayed for Single and Multi-Player**   | Screen transition occurs showing instructions that mimic typing. | User can type during this process and it displays to screen, otherwise as expected | This is slightly frustrating but doesn't impact function. Utilising tty-cursor to hide cursor so user is less tempted to type. |
| **Win and Loss Screens Generate Correctly**                  | On win the win cat is displayed and on loss the loss cat is displayed. | As expected                                                  | Nil                                                          |
| **User can Exit from Win and Loss screen**                   | Entering 'n' will allow the player to exit.                  | As expected                                                  | Nil                                                          |
| **User can Restart Loop from Win and Loss Screen**           | Entering 'y' will allow the player to exit.                  | As expected                                                  | Nil                                                          |
| **Only 'y' or 'n' Are Valid Inputs on Win and Loss Screen**  | Entering any other characters will prompt a message requesting the correct input. Will only continue to next step on 'y' or 'n'. | As expected                                                  | Nil                                                          |
| **Hangman Displays Correctly Depending on Guess Number**     | The hangman will generate from the array dependant on how many guesses have been tried and will display the correct hangman picture. | As expected                                                  | Nil                                                          |
| **ASCII Art Displays Correctly**                             | On all pages with ASCII art the image will display properly. | As expected                                                  | Nil                                                          |
| **Colorize Gem Will Display Colours Correctly**              | Whenever using colorize the string will generate with a colour. | As expected                                                  | Nil                                                          |
| **Command Line Arguments Load Correct Game Mode**            | With no command line argument the full game will launch including the menu. If "single" is entered as a command line argument the welcome screen will load and then proceed to the single-player mode. If "multi" is entered the welcome screen will load and then proceed to multi-player mode. On game end and choosing to continue the game will loop back to the correct game mode per the command line argument. | As expected                                                  | Nil                                                          |
| **Executable Files Run Correctly**                           | All gems will be installed and correct game mode will be launched. | As expected                                                  | Nil                                                          |
