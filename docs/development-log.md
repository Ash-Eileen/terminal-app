# Development Log

## Monday 20th April 2020

- Discussed four options for project with Nandini and Lin. Decided to go with Hangman app.
- Created README.md and GitHub repo.
- Created Trello board.
- Initialised repo on Mac and cloned on PC to ensure I could work across both.
- Added grading criteria to Trello.
- Started on Statement of Purpose and Scope to README.md

## Tuesday 21th April 2020

- Added development-log.md file
- Added features and user interaction and input section to README.md
- Created control flow diagram in draw.io. Spoke to Nandini to review this and updated as per her suggestions.
- Added control flow and implementation plan sections to README.md
- Created folders for classes and main.rb file.
- Created main functionality of game to ensure MVP was achieved.
- Played hangman with partner to test if it was working. Made small changes to display based on this testing.

## Wednesday 22th April 2020

- Researched ASCII images and gems to see how the game could best be displayed.
- Added menu screen and welcome displays.
- Refactored code in certain functions.
- Spoke to Nandini about how to best display hangman image and refactored code accordingly.
- Created executable files.
- Went through debugging with Nandini to figure out how to use command line arguments without creating issues in inputs.
- Added ASCII cats.
- Added instruction page to multi-player mode
- Created Gemfile
- Decided to remove the feature of requesting the players name in single-player mode.

## Halfway Point:

I've reached the halfway point of the program. It's functional at this stage. The screen transitions work as does the menu. It can be played without encountering any major errors from what I can see. I ran into a few issues with the command line arguments but was able to resolve this with Nandini's help. Right now I'm feeling fairly confident that I can have a fully functional app ready for submission. My next steps are to refactor code and update the UI to look more attractive as well as do a lot of testing.

## Thursday 23rd April 2020

- Updated executable files 
- Moved menu into screen_transitions.rb to delete extraneous file
- Went through code to try and make it DRY
- Added test cases. 
- Updated Gemfile to include gem for testing.
- Made sure application would meet all requirements in test file. This was focused around word generation and checking the guesses vs the word that the player needed to guess.
- Made small changes to styling
- Did manual testing.

## Saturday 25th April 2020

- Used rubocop to fix issues with styling conventions.
- Checked code against the [Airbnb Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/ruby)
- Adjust typing function speed to make it a little faster.
- More manual testing

## Sunday 26th April 2020

- Redid a lot of sections of the README.md to match the finished game.
- Added screenshots of gameplay and transition screens.
- Added help log.
- Tested that executable files worked as expected.
- Checked code again and comments.
- Added log about testing process.

## After Testing:

I'm feeling really happy with how everything has come together. I think the application looks good and works the way I want it to. The manual testing was a lot of fun because I got to play the game a fair bit. I did find writing the tests challenging but after I got my head around it felt really good to write a test and then see how the application responded to it. I really enjoyed showing the application to my family and partner who had been there throughout the whole process. Overall I feel like it turned out better than I expected which is a great feeling.
